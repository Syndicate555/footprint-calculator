          <div class="info-text">
            <p>
              Every year, billions of receipts are generated worldwide,
              significantly contributing to the consumption of natural
              resources, waste production, and greenhouse gas emissions.
              Understanding your receipt footprint is crucial for making
              environmentally conscious decisions that promote sustainability
              and minimize your ecological impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              Paper receipts are often overlooked when considering environmental
              concerns. However, they account for substantial deforestation,
              water usage, and energy consumption during the production process.
              Additionally, the chemicals used in printing, such as BPA and BPS,
              can have adverse effects on human health and the environment. With
              the immense quantity of receipts generated daily, these factors
              combined contribute to a substantial environmental burden.
            </p>
            <p>
              By comprehending the magnitude of your receipt footprint, you can
              actively work to reduce waste and support a greener environment.
              Adopting digital alternatives, such as centralized digital receipt
              solutions, can help minimize the environmental consequences
              associated with paper receipts. These eco-friendly alternatives
              not only reduce the demand for paper and energy but also eliminate
              the need for harmful chemicals in the printing process.

            <p>
              Paper receipts are often made from virgin paper, which requires
              the cutting down of trees for pulp production. This process leads
              to deforestation, which has a negative impact on ecosystems,
              contributes to climate change, and results in the loss of natural
              habitats for various species. By reducing the use of paper
              receipts and adopting digital alternatives, we can help to
              minimize deforestation and its associated consequences.

              The production of paper receipts involves several processes that
              negatively impact the environment. These include the consumption
              of water and energy, the emission of greenhouse gases, and the use
              of harmful chemicals such as BPA and BPS in thermal paper
              coatings. These chemicals can contaminate water sources and pose
              health risks to humans and wildlife. By opting for digital receipt
              solutions, we can significantly reduce the environmental impact
              associated with paper receipt production.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Paper receipts contribute to waste generation as they are often
              discarded shortly after being received. Many receipts are not
              recyclable due to their chemical coatings, which means they end up
              in landfills, further exacerbating waste management issues.
              Digital receipts help to minimize waste by eliminating the need
              for physical receipts and reducing the burden on landfills.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The recyclability of paper receipts depends on the type of paper
              they are made from. Many paper receipts are printed on thermal
              paper, which is coated with chemicals like BPA and BPS.
              Unfortunately, these chemicals make thermal paper receipts
              non-recyclable, as they can contaminate the recycling process and
              other recyclable materials. Consequently, most recycling
              facilities do not accept thermal paper receipts.
